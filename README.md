- recommendation API only takes up to 5 seed values, which is very limiting
- track does not have genre or popularity
- recommendation API when you put in the genres, it doesn't return a list of tracks that are entirely in that genre
  - for example, when I call classical genre, it returns some pop or japanese music.
